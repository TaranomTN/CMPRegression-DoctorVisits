## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English Version

### ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements and compares **three count regression models** â€” Poisson, Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP), and Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) â€” to model the number of doctor visits using real-world healthcare data.

The **CMP distribution** is particularly useful for modeling **over-dispersed or under-dispersed count data**, which is common in medical datasets where variance â‰  mean (violating Poisson assumptions).

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Fit count regression models to predict doctor visit frequency.
- Compare model performance using **NLL, MSE, RMSE, MAE**.
- Demonstrate the superiority of CMP in handling dispersion issues.

### ðŸ“Š Model Performance Comparison

| Model   | NLL         | MSE        | RMSE       | MAE        |
|---------|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Poisson | 3753.391119 | 0.602192   | 0.776011   | 0.452129   |
| ZIP     | 3550.806396 | 0.832637   | 0.912490   | 0.743798   |
| **CMP** | **3518.177246** | **0.421156** | **0.783904** | **0.421156** |

âœ… **Key Findings**:
- **CMP achieves the lowest NLL**, indicating better probabilistic fit.
- **Lowest MSE and MAE** â†’ more accurate predictions.
- ZIP improves over Poisson but still underperforms compared to CMP.
- This confirms that **CMP is more flexible and robust** for real-world count data with dispersion.

### ðŸ§  Why CMP?

Traditional Poisson regression assumes **mean = variance** â€” a condition rarely met in healthcare data (e.g., many patients have 0 visits, some have many â†’ overdispersion).

- **ZIP** handles excess zeros, but still assumes Poisson within non-zero part.
- **CMP** generalizes Poisson by introducing a dispersion parameter **Î½ (nu)**, allowing it to model both over- and under-dispersion.
